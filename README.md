# Refereeing

Tools for refereeing proposals.

## Scripts

- `eval_proposals.sh` Loop over pdfs+templates for sequential reading/reviewing of proposals. This can/should be customized with your favorite pdf reader (by appropriately setting `PDFREADER`).
- `referee_setup.sh` Given a directory of proposal pdfs, make blank review templates for each proposal.
